  // When picking a min aperture, we want to ensure that p2c can actually converge
  // when there are weights present. Based on empirical measurements, weights are well
  // respected when we have 4 or more servers.
  // The root of the problem is that you can't send a fractional request to the (potentially)
  // fractionally weighted edges of the aperture. The following thought experiment illustrates
  // this.
  // First, we consider the limiting case of only one weighted node. If we only have one node
  // to choose from, it's impossible to respect the weight since we will always return the
  // single node â€“ we need at least 2 nodes in this case.
  // Next, we extend the thought experiment to the case of pick2. How does the probability of
  // picking the second node change? Consider the case of 3 nodes of weights [1, 1, 0.5]. The
  // probability of node 2 being picked on the first try is 0.5/2.5, but it changes for the
  // second pick to 0.5/1.5. This shifting of probability causes a drift in the probability
  // of a node being either of the two picked and in the case of the three nodes above, the
  // probability of being picked either first or second is ~0.61 relative to nodes 0 or 1,
  // meaningfully different than the desired value of 0.50.
  // Next, we extrapolate this to the case of a large number of nodes. As the number of nodes
  // in the aperture increases the numerator (a node's weight) of the probability stays the same
  // but denominator (the sum of weights) increases. As N reaches infinity, the difference in
  // probability between being picked first or second converges to 0, restoring the probabilities
  // to what we expect. Running the same simulation with N nodes where the last node has 0.5
  // weight results in the following simulated probabilities (P) relative to nodes with weight 1
  // of picking the last node (weight 0.5) for either the first or second pick:
  //      N     2       3       4       6      10     10000
  //      P    1.0    0.61    0.56    0.53    0.52     0.50
  // While 4 healthy nodes has been determined to be sufficient for the p2c picking algorithm,
  // it is susceptible to finding it's aperture without any healthy nodes. While this is rare
  // in isolation it becomes more likely when there are many such sized apertures present.
  // Therefore, we've assigned the min to 12 to further decrease the probability of having a
  // aperture without any healthy nodes.
  // Note: the flag will be removed and replaced with a constant after tuning.
